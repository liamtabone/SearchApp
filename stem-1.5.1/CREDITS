The wrapper code for this extension was written by:
 Jay Smith    <jay@php.net>
 Olivier Hill <ohill@php.net>

The actual stemmers were all the result of C code spit out
by Dr. M.F. Porter's Snowball string processor. Snowball
essentially takes a file containing a stemmer definition
written in the Snowball language and outputs the equivalent
in ANSI C. Very cool.
