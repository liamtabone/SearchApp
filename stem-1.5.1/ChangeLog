ChangeLog:

09 Jun 2008

* Reimported the new API from Snowball and synchronize
  all currently available stemmers.
* Added Turkish (Unicode), Romanian and Hungarian stemmers
* Using current param parsing in ZE (don't manipulate zvals directly)
* Fix bug #12482
* Release of 1.5.0

23 Jan 2006

* We've got another developer to welcome to Team
  PHP Stemming Extension, so let's all welcome
  Olivier Hill. You might remember Olivier as 
  maintainer of the French translation of the
  PEAR manual. Olivier got the stem extension ready
  for inclusion into PECL and re-did the configuration
  files for the PEAR package system.
* Fixed up some of the aforementioned configuration
  files PECL-style. You can now install with the pear
  command a la "pear install stem-1.4.3.tar.gz".
* Release of 1.4.3.

06 Jan 2006

* Re-did a few areas that were causing problems on
  64-bit x86 boxes. Not sure what the problem was, but
  it seemed to be an engine problem. Need to take a 
  closer look at that.
* Added a new Unicode stemmer for Russian Cyrillic text.
  Use it as you would the other stemmers using the
  new russian_unicode() function or the STEM_RUSSIAN_UNICODE
  constant.
* Release of 1.4.2.

04 Aug 2005

* Fixed a tiny memory leak caused when stemming words
  of <= 0 length. The leak was pretty minimal at 1 byte,
  but it was still a leak nonetheless. Oops.
* Release of 1.4.1.


28 Mar 2002

* Fixed a bug relating to the lower-casing of words.
* Release of 1.4

18 Dec 2002

* Change all incoming words to lower-case before
  stemming. Snowball likes that.

27 Nov 2002

* Release of 1.3.
* Added some simple tests. The real tests involve
  gigantic word lists, and to save space, they're
  gzipped, so you need zlib enabled to do them.
  The real tests have been removed from the standard
  distribution, but are available from

    http://www.tutorbuddy.com/software/

26 Nov 2002

* Fixed up a bunch of tests. Note that English and
  Norwegian still don't work properly, as the output
  files seem to be behind on the Snowball site.

25 Nov 2002

* Various stemming algorithms changed to match changes
  found at Dr. Porter's site. TAKE NOTE: these may not be
  100% backwardly compatible with older versions of
  stem-php. You've been warned.


22 Nov 2002

* Finally did some more work. Added the ability to
  enable/disable languages via stemconf.h.
* New function: bool stem_enabled(int lang) -- returns
  true if the language has been enabled, false if it
  hasn't.
* Added a Finnish language stemmer.

06 May 2002

* Small fixes to the phpinfo() table block.

19 Apr 2002

* Although I released 1.2 yesterday, Dr. Porter was so
  quick to fix the minor bug (?) I found in Snowball
  that I'm releasing a new version with the updated
  stemmers already. This version is 1.2.1.

18 Apr 2002

* Released version 1.2.
* Added fixes to the Snowball generated sources to make
  them compile on Windows with VC++.
* Added VC++ 6 project files.

15 Apr 2002

* Removed some dumbass comments from stem.c.
* Added an include for stdlib.h to api.c to qwell some
  warnings.

13 Mar 2002

* Updated the sources for Snowball. See COPYING for the 
  specific files. This should fix a small memory leak. 

12 Feb 2002

* Finished the extension, for the most part.
* Yea.
